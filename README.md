**Collection of my AI projects**

**1 - A-star and BFS Search for Pancake-flipping problem**
Goal: Traverse graph to arrange pancakes in correct arrangement (smallest at top... and all unburnt sides facing up)

This program constructs a graph using a Python dictionary. The graph is generated by randomly flipping pancakes and forming parent-children pairs. The pancakes follow a "XX-XX-XX-XX" arrangement, where each 'X' in "XX" denotes the pancake size (1 to 4) and if its burnt or unburnt. A-star and BFS traversals are implemented to search through the graph and find the node with the correct arrangement. 

A star Heuristic: The # of pancakes out of order.

**2 - Alpha-Beta Pruning**
Goal: Use this technique to return the indices of pruned leaf in a graph

A smarter form of expecti-max, Alpha-beta pruning, is used to traverse through a tree and constantly update each node's alpha and beta values.

**3 - Model-Free Reinforcement Learning**
Goal: Use q-learning to get an agent from start to either goal states in a maze.
